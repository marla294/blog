		<p>Hi there.  I'm Marla!</p>

		<p>Here's my life story in one run-on sentence: Grew up in Ohio, went to University of Illinois for school, was an Electrical Engineer for a few years, a Software Quality Assurance engineer for (quite) a few more, now I'm learning Angular web development and chillaxing in Omaha, Nebraska with my 5 year old son and my (not 5 year old) husband.  If you want to know more about me, either professional or personal, you can head on over to my LinkedIn page, Github where this blog is hosted, or Twitter where I put my random thoughts.</p>

		<p>About the blog - made it entirely myself.  A labor of love.  I used Angular 5.ish (upgraded from 4 to 5 in the middle of blog creation) => TypeScript => JavaScript.  The styling uses Angular Material a little bit.  This website is going to be an evolving thing, because I just enjoy tinkering with it so much, so expect to see some changes to make it better and better :)</p>

		<p>First of all, since I missed Christmas and New Years with this blog... I hope anyone reading this had a great holiday season and a happy New Year!  I personally am very excited for 2018!</p>

		<p>Ironically, and eating-my-own-dogfood-ly, I am learning to be a web developer by developing this very blog you are reading... but it is getting pretty annoying having to put in test posts all the time to test out the doohickys I am making.  So I figured I would write an actual factual blog post, to fill things out a bit and to keep me away from tinkering on the blog for a second (I really need to start writing unit tests but I CAN'T. STOP. TINKERING.)</p>

		<p>As I mentioned in my "About Me" blog post, I am learning web development in Angular.  Learning it by going through the Angular docs (https://angular.io/).  Angular somewhat recently (late 2015ish) decided to switch over to using RXJS Observables for a lot of their built-in functionality (routing and http are the big ones I can think of off the cuff), and they hammer them a LOT in the docs.  Practically every cookbook has at least one Observable used in it.  Fulfilled Promises are nowhere to be found, just like in real life (sorry, professional dad-jokester here).  Observables can be a little tricky to understand, and it's kind of hard to find a good explanation about why Angular is so into them.  I'll tackle this subject and give you my take on it.</p>

		<p>The first thing to talk about is, what is this Observable thing?  Well, before RX Observables came the Observer/Subscriber design pattern, so let's describe that.  I like to think of it like a magazine.  Let's say that the Observable (also called a Subject) is Forbes magazine, and the Subscribers are people who want to get Forbes in the mail.  To get Forbes, I would have to subscribe to the magazine by sending in a subscription form, which is analogous to the "subscribe" function you'd use when working with Observables in code.  When Forbes is ready to produce a new issue, they know I want it so they will mail it to me, and the magazine will arrive at my door.  In our code example, you'd just already have the data at the same time that the Observable has it... the updated version was "delivered" to you in real time.  That's the design pattern in a nutshell.</p>

		<p>You can also think of it kind of like a "stream" of data, or like an array.  I feel these analogies are a little flawed, because you can't really get to any of the "older issues" in an Observable like you can in an array.  With an Observable, you always are holding the latest version, the "last" element in the array.  So for that reason, I don't love that analogy.  But, it is handy when looking at the operators available for use with Observables, which are very similar to functions you'd use with an array (map, anyone?).  And ReactiveX itself (see below) absolutely loves to draw pictures of Observables in the stream fashion... so I guess we might as well get used to it.</p>

		<p>I believe the "Gang of Four" (otherwise known as the "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" book) was the originator of the Observer/Subscriber design pattern (don't quote me on that).  But then a library was developed to allow people to actually create and use this pattern in many languages: ReactiveX (http://reactivex.io/).  RxJS is the javaScript version of the ReactiveX library, and is what you would use to work with Observables in Angular.</p>

		<p>So, back to the main question of this post, and the question I struggled with for a while... why use Observables?  There are a few reasons.  It streamlines code.  Rob Wormald gave a talk back when this was first rolling out in Angular (I'll link it in the References at the end) where he talks about writing code for a typeahead.  He wrote it both with and without Observables.  In the Observable-free one, he had to write a debouncing function and a few other helper functions to go along with it.  In the Observable one, they already have those operators built in, so the code was a lot shorter, cleaner, and you gotta assume that Rx knows what they're doing so it's less bug-prone than rolling your own.  On that note, the operators are another reason why Observables are cool.  There are a lot of them, and they are similar to ones you have probably already used for arrays, so it is pretty easy to get going with them.  Another major benefit is speed and efficiency.  Your subscribers don't have to go polling for updates all the time... they can just sit back, relax, have a cup of tea, and wait for their new issue of "userArray" to come to them when it is updated.</p>

	<div *ngSwitchCase="3">

		<p>If you read my last post about Observables, you'll note that this post is not about Observables like I promised.  But the idea of this post about CSS frameworks felt so good to me today and I really wanted to write it.  So, you'll just have to sit tight for that Observables post for now.</p>

		<p>I've explored 2 different CSS frameworks in the past couple months to use with the development of this website: Angular Material and Bootstrap.  I want to talk through my experience with each, and why/when you might want to use each one.</p>

		<h5>Angular Material</h5>

		<p>The first framework that I explored was Angular Material.  Angular Material is "both a UI Component framework and a reference implementation of Google's Material Design Specification" (quoth <a href="https://material.angularjs.org/1.1.3/">this page</a>).  Google Material Design is a design language... kind of a specification of how to lay things out on the web.</p>  

		<p>I thought that since I was developing in Angular, Angular Material would be a good CSS framework to compliment that.  The idea of making the web easier to use by using visual cues was appealing as well.  Ease of use and accessibility are kind of my thing.</p>

		<p>Material certainly looks cool.  Buttons have a fancy ripple effect.  When you enter text in a textbox, there's a multi-colored line that underlines it.  Their little "tags" that you can use for things like categories are fun.  Their components are really neat-looking overall.</p>

		<p>Also, it was fairly easy to install.  Since it's part of the Angular universe, and I am using Angular for my project, I could pick and choose what elements I wanted to import and bring them in on the app module, instead of having to bring in the whole thing (ala Bootstrap).</p>

		<p>But, there are some pretty hefty drawbacks to using Angular Material as your one and only CSS framework.  It's not easy to change the theming on the elements.  They make you pick a theme, and if you don't like the colors or you need more padding on something, you might need to do a ton of CSS writing to change it, or just accept that you're stuck with it.  I suppose the reason is because of all those cool effects... if you were able to easily change to some colors, those effects might break.</p>

		<p>Another drawback is that there aren't a ton of components or utilities to use.  For example, they don't have a "container" class that you could just put on a div... the closest they've got is a card element.  I don't know about you, but I didn't fancy putting my website pages onto giant cards!  I just wanted to spruce up the pages that I've got.</p>

		<p>Finally, for the above mentioned reasons, when you design stuff using Angular Material, it looks like you are associated with Google in some way.  That might legitimately be good if you have a "sign in with Google" function in your appication, or if you really are associated with Google.  But, if you're me, a Google-fangirl who is not affiliated, then it looks kinda weird.</p>

		<p>Maybe I misunderstood what Material's intended purpose is.  It does say right in their docs that they are a "component framework", not a "CSS framework".  I can see now that I don't think they are going for being an all-inclusive CSS framework... I think they just wanted to provide some components that you can select from to use in your website, a la carte style.  In that respect, I'd say their components are good and nice to use in that way.  But for a thing like the styling of a website, I needed something more.</p>

		<h5>Bootstrap</h5>

		<p>That brings me to Bootstrap.  Bootstrap really is that all-inclusive framework.  And it was love at first container for me.</p>

		<p>I like that you don't have to import every single component that you want to use like you have to do with Angular Material.  You just import it once, stick some scripts on your index html file, and go.  Bootstrap operates off classes.  If you want a container, you just add class="container" to your element.  No having to remember to import the "container" element in the app module.  Easy peasy.  Everything is nicely aligned for you, and looks good in different environments (aka, it's responsive).</p>

		<p>Another great thing about Bootstrap is all of the utilities that they add in.  You want more padding?  Add "p-2" to your element to see how it looks (p = padding, the number after is 1-5, 1 for less 5 for more).  Want to float an element?  Use the float-left class.  Uggh it is so easy to quickly tweak an element without having to actually write CSS!  CSS files get ugly and complex.  In Angular you have CSS files for each component, so they stack up and it can get confusing what is being applied where.  Writing actual CSS is good for adding global styles, like having your links be a specific color when you hover.  But for little tweaks on individual elements on a page, Bootstrap is amazing.</p>

		<p>Finally, I am a lover of good documentation.  Bootstrap delivers.  Partly because their framework makes such sense and is easy to use already, their documentation is thorough but also easy to undertand, and even, dare I say, memorize.  How hard is it to remember that p is for padding!</p>

		<h5>Summary</h5>

		<p>Overall, if you are developing a website in Angular, I would highly recommend Bootstrap over Angular Material for a CSS framework.  But if you have a specific use for Angular Material, or if you are affiliated with Google in some way, it wouldn't be too hard to add in the couple components that you need and use it in conjunction with Bootstrap.</p>

		<p>Hello!  My bad for not writing for so long.  I'm plugging away at coding.  It's hard to write blog posts about development, and takes up time that I could be spending actually making things, which is the highest priority for me.  I will write more about dev eventually... for now I wanted to take the blog in a more "traditional" direction, for a blog anyway.</p>

		<p>As you can probably tell by my one sentence About Me post, I haven't been super keen on writing about myself.  Which makes things interesting since this is a BLOG and that's kinda what seems to be expected.  I've changed a ton in the past half year.  I've changed so much that it has been hard to figure out what I really want to talk about now.  But I finally came up with an idea the other day that I love.  I want to talk about people from my past, and my present, that I deeply appreciate, and why.  Going to call it the "open letter of appreciation" series.</p>

		<p>I'm going to make up names for people that I put on here.  I just want to respect their privacy.  They'd definitely know who they are from reading these stories.</p>

		<h2>Joe, the calmest guy at Northrop Grumman</h2>

		<p>We're going to call this first guy Joe.  Joe was my coworker at Northrop Grumman, in Rolling Meadows Illinois, when I first started my career and was still doing RF engineering.  We worked together for about 2 and a half years... man I can't believe it was that long, it seems really short in retrospect.</p>

		<p>Joe is probably the calmest person I have ever met in my life.  No matter what happened, no matter if someone was freaking out or something didn't go right, Joe was just like, eh oh well, everything will probably work out.  It was flipping amazing.  NGC had a parts ordering system where, if you needed to buy a $5 pack of resistors, you had to order it on this archaic DOS look-alike system, and it would literally take a minimum of 6 months to arrive.  By the time you got them you couldn't remember why you ordered them.  I'd come over to his desk and be like WTFOMGBBQ PARTS JOE!!!!  And he would just calmly place the order for me while I finished freaking out.</p>

		<p>On top of that, Joe was extremely patient.  I'd go over to his cubicle and ask him a million questions about how things worked (he designed the stuff I was working on and was very smart) and he would sit there and answer every one of them.  I was like, 22, 23 years old and even I realized after a couple hours of questioning that, holy cow Marla this is getting ridiculous, but he was still there answering those silly questions for me!</p>

		<p>The thing that I admired the most about Joe is how he treated me, and everyone else, with respect.  No matter if you were some 22 year old newbie like me asking you questions for 2 hours straight (probably on a Monday), or if you were the head honcho, if you asked for Joe's time and attention, you got it.</p>

		<p>Something he did that makes me so happy to think about, even now, is when I quit, he threw a huge surprise "goodbye" party for me.  I had no idea about it and I went into this room and there were 30 people in there, and pizza, and they even had a slideshow about the "top 10 Marla moments!"  That was so amazing.</p>

		<p>At the time I took him for granted.  I thought every job would have a Joe in it.  I'm so appreciative that I got to work with him.  I hope things are going better than ever in his life.</p>

		<p>I've got a post entirely about me and how I learn.  I've been thinking about this topic a lot lately.  The way I learn is probably not so different from the way others do.  But I think over the years, because I was listening to other people's opinions on how one "should" learn things best, when I heard something different from how I do it, I labeled my way the "wrong" way and tried to do it the "right" way.  Now I see it as, there's no wrong or right way to learn things, there's just your way.</p>

		<p>I've been learning how to be a software developer for the past 8 months.  I had a couple options for how to go about becoming a developer.  One was to go back to college, and the other was to go to a code bootcamp.  I have a bachelors in electrical engineering, that I obtained from a top 3 engineering school while playing golf on scholarship.  Oh and a math minor.  So yeah, after that grueling experience, more college did not sound appealing, or honestly, necessary (I'm already an engineer, yo).  I was seriously considering going to code school.  In fact I thought that was what I was doing until about a month before I started this.  But, then the idea came up that, maybe I could do this on my own... and that felt way better than any of the other options.</p>

		<p>When I was like, 11 or 12, we had a computer at home.  It eventually got moved up to my room.  I had heard about this thing called the "internet" where you could talk to people through the computer.  I heard that it worked through the phone lines.  I had a phone line in my room that wasn't hooked up to anything.  So... I recall spending a day tinkering and trying everything I could to get that computer somehow hooked up to the internet.  I found a rubber hose, and jerry-rigged something to go from the phone line to the computer.  There was a settings application on my computer that said something about internet on it and I tried typing all kinds of stuff to try to connect.  Unfortunately, after 3 or so hours of tinkering, nothing worked and I gave up.</p>

		<p>That's how I roll when it comes to learning or, anything really.  I throw out the instruction manual, and just try crap until something works.  In school and in college, I noted that classes themselves really didn't help me learn that much.  I went to them, because I always worried if I didn't go I would miss something.  But the real thing that helped me learn was trying to do the math or engineering problem myself, looking at the answer in the back of the book, and if I didn't get it right, trying things until I did.  That was really the only thing that worked for me.</p>

		<p>I've heard a lot that other people swear by working with other people, or working in groups.  I'd study in the library in college and there would be tables of 20 people working together.  That's great for you, other people.  I wish so hard that I could do that.  But other people and their weird thoughts about how to solve the problem at hand distract me.  I'd rather struggle through it on my own.</p>

		<p>Another "different" thing about me and how I learn and just, do... things... in the world?, is that I like to just visualize the outcome and then when I'm ready, take steps toward it.</p>

		<p>When I was in college, I played on the women's golf team.  There was an assistant coach on our team who was really into studying the course, and writing down every little detail in her yardage book, during the practice round before the tournament.  She said she would hit a ball to each side of the fairway on her drive, then hit 2-3 balls toward the green, study how the green sloped, study how the wind was blowing... basically study every dang thing on every hole of the course and write it in that book.  Probably no surprise this coach is now a lawyer.</p>

		<p>Anyway, this approach sounded very appealing to me.  There was a kind of "it's all planned out for me" orderly feeling to it.  So, there was a tournament where we had to play 36 holes in a day, and I decided to try her approach out.  The first 18 holes, I used that yardage book, I studied and analyzed every shot, and I used the club the yardage book and my brain said to use.  Shot a 78, which is not bad.  But following that yardage book was pretty tiring.  I decided to go back to my old way of doing it for the second round.  My "old way" consisted of, looking at the fairway, visualizing where I wanted my shot to go, and then hitting it that way.  Then when I would walk up to the next shot, I'd be thinking about how I wanted that shot to go... and so on.  On the second round, I shot a 75.  From that day forward, I ditched the yardage book idea and just kept on working the same way that had worked for me all those years before.</p>

		<p>I still get caught up trying to over-analyze my way through things.  It seems like fun.  And it obviously works for some times of people - see example high-powered lawyer/former assistant coach above.  Those types of people seem like they've got it together.  But... I'm just not like that.  Planning, for me, obscures the real work of just, doing the thing.</p>

		<p>It gets a little tricky when it comes to learning to code.  You gotta learn the language, obviously, and that involves going through tutorials and "analyzing," which to me feels like the golf coach writing things down in her book, but it's necessary.  But then, after a while, I needed to just put the Angular Docs webpage down, and just code something.  It's a fine line between analyzing and doing.</p>

		<p>Well, that's all I've got for today.  Later!</p>

		<p>Hello!  I can't believe it's March already.  I had a great time writing the last post, and it's nice to have an outlet to just talk about what I'm working on.  So I figured I'd write a little bit more this morning about what I'm currently up to.</p>

		<p>Got the idea a month or so ago to make a checkers game.  My son (5 years old) helped me test it :).  If you'd like to see it it's here: https://marla294.github.io/checkers/</p>

		<p>Now I'm working on making a chess game in the same manner.  I copied the old checkers game code and extended it.  The chess game is here: https://marla294.github.io/chess/</p>

		<p>What's been fun about making the chess game has been that it's a bit more complex than checkers.  First I got all the pieces moving around the board in the right way, and capturing other pieces like they should.  Then I had to figure out how to indicate that the king was in check.  Each time I did something new, I had to re-work the old code to make it do what I wanted.  Oh, this function should work for any piece on the board, not just the selected piece that I'm going to move.  Things like that.</p>

		<p>Now I'm working on how to tell the user when someone wins the game.  This has been super hard, but fun to figure out.  I figured out that, when the king is in check, there can only be one piece that is checking the king at the time.  So there are 3 options for the team that is in check.  The first is to move the king out of check, if there is a space for him to move to.  The second is to take the piece that is checking the king.  And the third is to move a piece inbetween the piece that is checking the king and the king.</p>

		<p>The interesting part for me has been to figure out how to code the checkmate function.  There's a couple routes that I can see to go.  The first route is to test the 3 scenarios mentioned above - whether the king can "run away," whether the checking piece can be taken, and whether a piece can be moved inbetween the checking piece and the king.  The second route would be to just figure out all the possible moves that the current team could make and see if, with one of them, the king is put in a safe position.</p>

		<p>Option 1 is definitely less expensive.  You don't have to check all possible moves on the board, only the ones that would definitely help the king.  I went that route at first (before I thought of option 2).</p>

		<p>But I think I'm going to try out option 2.  I've only coded the first 2 parts of option 1 (the king running away and taking the piece putting the king in check), and right now the thought of trying to figure out how to move a piece inbetween the checking piece and the king just makes me want to cry!  It seems very difficult given the way I've set up the code.  Also, after I finish making the chess game, I want to try putting in a "play against the computer" option, and the code for this could be re-used in that.  We'll see.  Perhaps the "moving every piece on the board" route is going to be way too slow and I'll have to go back to option 1 anyway.</p>

		<p>Well, that's all I got... now I'm going to go try this!  Later!</p>

		<p>Hello!  It's pretty obvious that I haven't had a post on here for a while.  There's a reason for that.  I've been working on a project, that, for various reasons, I haven't wanted to share about online.  It is almost done now, so when it's ready (and I'm ready) I will probably put it up on Twitter.</p>

		<p>So, now that that project is almost complete, today I decided to totally switch gears and learn ReactJS.  I can't give you an exact reason why I want to learn React.  I've just wanted to learn it for a while.  And, YOLO, so... I ponied up for the Wes Bos "React for Beginners" course.  It feels a little like cheating to be talking about learning React on my blog which is written in Angular... but here we are.  Deal with it, Angular.</p>

		<p>I haven't gone through the whole course yet but I can already see a few differences between React and Angular.  The major thing I see (and maybe this is why I wanted to learn it) is that, React just feels more fun!  I like that you put everything in components, and that there are states that hook up to the components and you can change the state throughout the app.  Angular is more acedemic and strict.  They're both good for their own purposes.  I'm extremely glad that I learned and worked in Angular first, so that I could learn a few extra libraries that they kinda force you to use (RxJS, I'm looking at you).  The Angular docs taught me so much about software development and coding, and I am super appreciative of them still.</p>

		<p>That's all I've got for today!</p>

		<p>Hello!  If you follow me on social media, you probably saw that yesterday I decided to take a social media break for a month to focus on preparing for interviewing.  Sorry for the whiplash that likely caused you to have if you follow my social media.  I finished making the decision yesterday that I want to start interviewing for dev jobs, and now the next step is to strategize how to go about this.  So I figured, hey, let's share it with the internet!  Why not.</p>

		<p>So first, let's start by talking high level.</p>

		<h2>Why I want a job now</h2>

		<p>One of the biggest reasons is that I really love working with other people on software projects, and I miss that.  I really like collaborating with others and learning from them and being inspired by them.  Some of the biggest influences in my life have come from work.</p>

		<p>Another reason is that it is darn hard to come up with ideas and to create an entire software package entirely on your own, especially when you are new.  It is slow going.  Everything is brand new and breaks constantly.  At a company, you can focus on one part of it and get really good at that.  I like learning the new stuff, and working on my own, but man, I could use a little break to just focus on getting better at coding.</p>

		<p>Finally, I just really want to get good at development.  I haven't had many code reviews over here.  In a way it has been good to have to struggle and figure it out on my own.  It has given me the confidence that I can actually do this, even if I have to go it alone.  But, I'm ready to see how I can improve things and level up my skills.  Working with other people who are more experienced and getting their feedback would help.</p>

		<h2>Why it's okay if I don't get a job right away</h2>

		<p>Have to add this part in for myself, because I don't want to put so much pressure on myself that I get paralyzed and can't make progress.</p>

		<p>I am lucky in that my husband and I are doing well enough financially that I can continue to not make money for a while longer.</p>

		<p>Also, if it happens that I just can't seem to find a job at all, I will keep leveling up my skills on my own until something comes along - I have a list a mile long of things I want to learn and classes to take.  So I'll keep doing that and practicing interviewing until I break through.  There are also other avenues that I could try... freelancing, trying self-employment, etc.  The main thing is not to give up.</p>

		<h2>What kind of job do I want?</h2>

		<p>I want a front-end dev position to start.  That is what I've worked toward and have really enjoyed.  It does seem like server-side could be fun for me too.  But to get my foot in the door, front-end is what I'm going for right now.</p>

		<h2>Strategy</h2>

		<p>I've set a goal for myself that I want to feel ready to at least try a technical interview in 3 weeks.  That might be aggressive, but I really want this.  So here are the things that I am going to need to do to prepare.</p>

		<ol>
			<li><b>Finish my resume: </b>Why is this so hard?  Beats me.  But obvs, still gotta do it.</li>
			<li><b>Create React single-page app: </b>I just finished Wes Bos' React course at warp speed in 2.5 days.  I gotta solidify that new knowledge by making a small app in React.</li>
			<li><b>Polish Chesskers: </b>Otherwise known as Chess in my Github repos.  This poor thing suffers from lack of frontend attention to detail.  I want to give it some love.</li>
			<li><b>Prepare for Interviewing: </b>This could be a list in itself, and should hopefully take up 80% of the next 3 weeks.  I'll be following this <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/cracking-the-front-end-interview-9a34cd46237" style="text-decoration: underline">guide</a>.</li>
			<li>(Update)<b>Prepare for the Whiteboard Problems of Doom: </b>Ok, for me, perhaps this is a bit overkill... but overkill is my middle name.  My brother suggested I go through <a href="https://leetcode.com/problemset/algorithms/" style="text-decoration: underline">this</a> until I can do the mediums with minimal difficulty.  I'll do my best, bro.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>I'm planning to pull out all the stops to get this done.  That's why no more social media.  I made a tweet on twitter a week ago that randomly got 4000 impressions, and that was super fun to watch, and it hooked me back in.  At the end of the day though, are good tweets or instagram pictures going to get me a job?  No.  No, they are not.  It seems that I can't do things in moderation, it's either all in or nothing at all.  So I have to take a break from those while I work on this.</p>

		<h2>Wrapping up</h2>

		<p>I do want to say that, it sucks that I have to basically put the skids on learning new, practical things like I have been doing in order to "study" for an interview.  Seems like the process is a little broken there.  But, what are you gonna do.  I guess it's like a weed out course in college where you have to show that you do have the smarts and the drive to go the rest of the way.  In any case, challenge accepted.</p>

		<p>Hey hey!  I'm psyched that I got the fists to come through the json on the title of this post :).  It's the small things.</p>

		<p>I'm taking my "lunch break" now so I figured I'd write a little post talking about the differences I see between Angular and React.  Currently I'm building a super simple resume website in React.  It's on Github (resume-app), though it is not "out there" to view on the internet yet.  Probably not going to host it through Github Pages this time, as I hear React apps are finicky with Github Pages, and I'll probably use now or something.  Anyhoo, through my limited, week-long experience with React, here are the differences between React and Angular that I've found.</p>

		<h2>Services vs State</h2>

		<p>Angular looooooooves services.  They have a whole module in their documentation on using dependency injection to set up services, and they recommend any and all data collection go into a service.  The service doesn't come with the Angular app.  You've gotta make your own and put it in there, and know where to inject it, all that good stuff.</p>

		<p>React has a built in sort of service layer with the idea of state.  This is where you can store local data in your app.  It seems like state is typically defined on the App component of your React application, though I think you can also store state elsewhere if you prefer.</p>

		<h2>Templates vs JSX</h2>

		<p>Angular's components use external html template.  You can either write the html directly into the component file, or you can link to the html file.  All of this is done in the component decorator.</p>

		<p>React uses JSX.  It's javascript/html hybrid.  You write your html and javascript together and return it for the component in a "render" statement.  There's no external template, at least not that I know of.  I suppose this kind of encourages the developer to break components down into smaller pieces, because otherwise your component file could get huge and unwieldly.</p>

		<h2>Passing Data</h2>

		<p>To pass data to a component in Angular, you have to set up an input variable inside the Angular component with an @Input decorator.  Then on your parent component you can pass data in like so: [your variable]="your data".</p>

		<p>In React, data is passed around using props.  All you gotta do is say myprop = this.state.myprop (there should be brackets around this.state.myprop, but Angular uses those in templates to pass data and I am not going to spend time figuring out how to escape those right now) on your child component in the parent component and you've passed the data!</p>

		<h2>Cool Dev Tools</h2>

		<p>React has an awesome tool in Chrome that you can use to view the state and props on your app, and see how things are being rendered.  Angular doesn't have anything like that, to my knowledge.  Womp womp.</p>

		<h2>Overall</h2>

		<p>To me, it feels like React took all the setup stuff that Angular has and just built it in, so you can focus on just building a website.  You don't have to think about where you should inject your service to get data.  You don't have to remember to put an @input decorator on a variable in your component so you can pass data.  In some ways that is kind of nice.  But, it's possible that maybe later on I will want more control over how things are set up, and in that case I may want to use a tool like Angular.</p>

		<p>Also, because you don't have to know or learn any design patterns and setup stuff, I can see how React would be a lot easier for developers to learn and use than Angular.  It really feels like Angular-lite!  I'm very glad that I learned Angular first, since I'm a new developer, because I learned a ton from going through their documentation.</p>

		<p>I wouldn't say that I prefer one over the other.  It depends on what you are going for.  It seems like Angular would probably be best for big companies, creating an app that is closed behind a login page (Angular doesn't do pre-rendering very well, so SEO is bad, so it is not often used for blogs) and that they want a high degree of customization on.  I think that a newer developer would probably like React better, as it is easier to get up and running with.  It seems better suited for smaller web applications or for "fun" websites, like Instagram, and... dun dun DUNNN... Facebook.  It's modular and overally just a little more interesting and fun to work with in general.</p>

		<p>That's it!  Take care,</p>

	<div *ngSwitchCase="11">

		<p>Yes, you heard me right!  For a couple of reasons, I decided to not import Bootstrap for that React project I've been working on, my portfolio site.  Initially, I did try importing it, but the Bootstrap Sass in the project was overwriting all of my internal styles and I was spending too much time getting that sorted out.  And also, since I've been learning more with the intention of starting a job search soon, there were a few things I wanted to practice in vanilla CSS anyway.</p>

		<p>At first I was like, uggh... this is not going to be fun.  Bootstrap makes everything look pretty and you can just stick classes on elements to quickly pop in a style.  And CSS can be confusing to work with in frameworks, as your files can be separated out among different components.</p>

		<p>But once I really got into it, I enjoyed it quite a lot!  And in fact, I might just write my own CSS for projects going forward, because it's fun and because I believe it will help me be a better front end developer in the future.  Here are some of the main things I learned from this process and why I'm excited about writing CSS this way now.</p>

		<h2>Best practices</h2>

		<p>The main reason I got into using plain old CSS was because I learned about some best practices of writing CSS through my studies to ace interviews.  Object-Oriented CSS, BEM, CSS pre-processors, etc.  I'm naturally drawn to efficiency and making things smaller, simpler and easier to use.  Learning about this stuff made me want to implement these practices to see if I could write better CSS.</p>

		<h2>CSS built-in features</h2>

		<p>The latest version of CSS (CSS3) has a lot of built-in features that older versions of CSS didn't have.  One that I used all the flippin time is flexbox.  Flexbox is amazing.  I am probably just scratching the surface of ways it can be used (I just use it to center stuff mostly) but I still love it.</p>

		<p>Another thing you can do (that I haven't used much yet) is use variables.  I'm not sure why I haven't done it yet... maybe I'll go back and refactor CSS and try them out.</p>

		<h2>Dev tools!</h2>

		<p>This was probably the thing that I had the most fun with on the portfolio project, and what made Bootstrap fall flat this time.  You can go into dev tools and switch on and off the styles for each class or element, or manually edit the values and see what happens!  You can even add styles in.  So, this time, the process I took was to just write the CSS and get the project looking as good as I could, and after I got it looking pretty good I went into dev tools and turned on and off styles to see what happened.  I was able to eliminate a lot of attributes that weren't really doing anything, and see how I could consolidate the CSS more to make the same things happen with less.  Super fun!</p>

		<h2>Emmet</h2>

		<p>I just recently learned about Emmet, and so I didn't get to use it on this project, but I can't wait to try it!  Emmet is a plugin that makes writing HTML and CSS super easy.  For a simple example with HTML, say you want to make a paragraph tag.  You just type "p" and then the tab key, and Emmet replaces the p with a full HTML paragraph tag!  You can add classes, ids, nest tags... you could write a full HTML document just using Emmet and click tab to populate it all out!  It is super cool.  You can even use it with JSX, which is going to be SO SUPER HELPFUL because right now Sublime doesn't populate the HTML tags for me in js files.  Just gotta click ctrl+e to get it to populate instead of tab.</p>

		<p>You can also use Emmet with CSS properties.  Emmet uses "fuzzy search," so you just type what you think the abbreviation might be in the CSS selector and then hit the tab key, and it'll populate!  Like if I wanted to do margin-bottom, I'd try mb and then tab and see if it came up.  The fuzzy search is supposed to be pretty good so around 90% of the time you'll get what you were searching for.</p>

		<h2>Wes Bos</h2>

		<p>I have to admit that Wes Bos' course on React was a big inspiration for me in terms of CSS writing.  He probably wouldn't have expected that, but it is true!  He doesn't discuss CSS at all during the course (except to show how to do animations in React), but the application at the end looks really really good.  He does it all in one "styles.css" file, and I believe he uses Stylus (CSS pre-processor) to write it.  It just showed me what you can do just writing CSS on your own.</p>

		<p>For the record, Wes Bos has some really great stuff.  That's where I learned about Emmet too, I've been going through his Sublime power users course.  He makes learning to code and learning new tools fun!  I hope to eventually work through all his courses.</p>

		<p>Well, that's it for today.  Go forth and write some CSS!</p>

		<p>Algorithms.  And data structures.  And bears, oh my!</p>

		<p>I've been working on finding a job!  For me, this requires a couple parts.  The first part is your standard job search tango.  The Indeed searches, the flipping on of the "recruiters can contact me" Bat-Signal on LinkedIn, the filling out of applications, and a few times talking with actual people about actual jobs on actual phones.  The job search is a skill in itself.  The whole "talking to someone else without making a joke and acting professional" thing does not come naturally.  Each time I look for a job, it usually takes a little while to ramp up.</p>

		<p>The additional part, because I am going for a software engineering job, is to learn the data structures and algorithms and design patterns that CS students learn in college.  At least to a basic level of competency.</p>

		<p>In an earlier post, I may have whined a little about having to do this.  I take back my whine.  I am having so much fun!  It's like going back to college and solving math problems all over again.  I love math!  I was a math minor in college because I just liked it so much and it was easy for me.  Well, except for differential equations... let's not talk about THAT class that I'm still not sure how I passed.</p>

		<p>And also, I heart learning.  I've learned a lot about the JavaScript language and its inner workings through this study.  Seeing things that I saw before that didn't make sense to me, like React refusing to autobind its component methods, suddenly come into clearer view is so rewarding.</p>

		<p>For a little while, new projects are on the back burner.  I am still working on improving my existing projects as I have the time.  Once I've completed all the "must know" algorithms and data structures and done a fair amount more LeetCode problems, I'll go back to regularly scheduled programming (har har har).</p>
