		<p>Hi there.  I'm Marla!</p>

		<p>Here's my life story in one run-on sentence: Grew up in Ohio, went to University of Illinois for school, was an Electrical Engineer for a few years, a Software Quality Assurance engineer for (quite) a few more, now I'm learning Angular web development and chillaxing in Omaha, Nebraska with my 5 year old son and my (not 5 year old) husband.  If you want to know more about me, either professional or personal, you can head on over to my LinkedIn page, Github where this blog is hosted, or Twitter where I put my random thoughts.</p>

		<p>About the blog - made it entirely myself.  A labor of love.  I used Angular 5.ish (upgraded from 4 to 5 in the middle of blog creation) => TypeScript => JavaScript.  The styling uses Angular Material a little bit.  This website is going to be an evolving thing, because I just enjoy tinkering with it so much, so expect to see some changes to make it better and better :)</p>

		<p>First of all, since I missed Christmas and New Years with this blog... I hope anyone reading this had a great holiday season and a happy New Year!  I personally am very excited for 2018!</p>

		<p>Ironically, and eating-my-own-dogfood-ly, I am learning to be a web developer by developing this very blog you are reading... but it is getting pretty annoying having to put in test posts all the time to test out the doohickys I am making.  So I figured I would write an actual factual blog post, to fill things out a bit and to keep me away from tinkering on the blog for a second (I really need to start writing unit tests but I CAN'T. STOP. TINKERING.)</p>

		<p>As I mentioned in my "About Me" blog post, I am learning web development in Angular.  Learning it by going through the Angular docs (https://angular.io/).  Angular somewhat recently (late 2015ish) decided to switch over to using RXJS Observables for a lot of their built-in functionality (routing and http are the big ones I can think of off the cuff), and they hammer them a LOT in the docs.  Practically every cookbook has at least one Observable used in it.  Fulfilled Promises are nowhere to be found, just like in real life (sorry, professional dad-jokester here).  Observables can be a little tricky to understand, and it's kind of hard to find a good explanation about why Angular is so into them.  I'll tackle this subject and give you my take on it.</p>

		<p>The first thing to talk about is, what is this Observable thing?  Well, before RX Observables came the Observer/Subscriber design pattern, so let's describe that.  I like to think of it like a magazine.  Let's say that the Observable (also called a Subject) is Forbes magazine, and the Subscribers are people who want to get Forbes in the mail.  To get Forbes, I would have to subscribe to the magazine by sending in a subscription form, which is analogous to the "subscribe" function you'd use when working with Observables in code.  When Forbes is ready to produce a new issue, they know I want it so they will mail it to me, and the magazine will arrive at my door.  In our code example, you'd just already have the data at the same time that the Observable has it... the updated version was "delivered" to you in real time.  That's the design pattern in a nutshell.</p>

		<p>You can also think of it kind of like a "stream" of data, or like an array.  I feel these analogies are a little flawed, because you can't really get to any of the "older issues" in an Observable like you can in an array.  With an Observable, you always are holding the latest version, the "last" element in the array.  So for that reason, I don't love that analogy.  But, it is handy when looking at the operators available for use with Observables, which are very similar to functions you'd use with an array (map, anyone?).  And ReactiveX itself (see below) absolutely loves to draw pictures of Observables in the stream fashion... so I guess we might as well get used to it.</p>

		<p>I believe the "Gang of Four" (otherwise known as the "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" book) was the originator of the Observer/Subscriber design pattern (don't quote me on that).  But then a library was developed to allow people to actually create and use this pattern in many languages: ReactiveX (http://reactivex.io/).  RxJS is the javaScript version of the ReactiveX library, and is what you would use to work with Observables in Angular.</p>

		<p>So, back to the main question of this post, and the question I struggled with for a while... why use Observables?  There are a few reasons.  It streamlines code.  Rob Wormald gave a talk back when this was first rolling out in Angular (I'll link it in the References at the end) where he talks about writing code for a typeahead.  He wrote it both with and without Observables.  In the Observable-free one, he had to write a debouncing function and a few other helper functions to go along with it.  In the Observable one, they already have those operators built in, so the code was a lot shorter, cleaner, and you gotta assume that Rx knows what they're doing so it's less bug-prone than rolling your own.  On that note, the operators are another reason why Observables are cool.  There are a lot of them, and they are similar to ones you have probably already used for arrays, so it is pretty easy to get going with them.  Another major benefit is speed and efficiency.  Your subscribers don't have to go polling for updates all the time... they can just sit back, relax, have a cup of tea, and wait for their new issue of "userArray" to come to them when it is updated.</p>

		<p>If you read my last post about Observables, you'll note that this post is not about Observables like I promised.  But the idea of this post about CSS frameworks felt so good to me today and I really wanted to write it.  So, you'll just have to sit tight for that Observables post for now.  I promise to avoid promising things in blog posts from now on :)</p>

		<p>I've explored 2 different CSS frameworks in the past couple months to use with the development of this website: Angular Material and Bootstrap.  I want to talk through my experience with each, and why/when you might want to use each one.</p>

		<h5>Angular Material</h5>

		<p>The first framework that I explored was Angular Material.  Angular Material is "both a UI Component framework and a reference implementation of Google's Material Design Specification" (quoth <a href="https://material.angularjs.org/1.1.3/">this page</a>).  Google Material Design is a design language... kind of a specification of how to lay things out on the web.</p>  

		<p>I thought that since I was developing in Angular, Angular Material would be a good CSS framework to compliment that.  The idea of making the web easier to use by using visual cues was appealing as well.  Ease of use and accessibility are kind of my thing.</p>

		<p>I was right about the "looking cool" part.  Buttons have a fancy ripple effect.  When you enter text in a textbox, there's a little line that underlines it.  Their little "tags" that you can use for things like categories are fun.  Their components are really cool-looking overall.</p>

		<p>Also, it was fairly easy to install.  Since it's part of the Angular universe, and I am using Angular for my project, I could pick and choose what elements I wanted to import and bring them in on the app module, instead of having to bring in the whole thing (ala Bootstrap).</p>

		<p>But, there are some pretty hefty drawbacks to Angular Material, and that is why I'm not using it on this site.  It's not easy to change the theming on the elements.  They make you pick a theme, and if you don't like the colors or you need more padding on something, you might need to do a ton of CSS writing to change it, or just accept that you're stuck with it.  I suppose the reason is because of all those cool effects... if you were able to easily change to some colors, those effects might break.</p>

		<p>Another drawback is that there aren't a ton of components or utilities to use.  For example, they don't have a "container" class that you could just put on a div... the closest they've got is a card element.  Ain't nobody want to put all their webpages on giant cards!</p>

		<p>Finally, for the above mentioned reasons, when you design stuff using Angular Material, it looks like you are associated with Google in some way.  That might legitimately be good if you have a "sign in with Google" function in your appication, or if you really are associated with Google.  But, if you're me, a Google-fangirl who is not affiliated (but, hey Google... I sure wouldn't MIND having a job with you... call me!) then it looks kinda weird.</p>

		<p>Maybe I misunderstood what Material's intended purpose is.  It does say right in their docs that they are a "component framework", not a "CSS framework".  I don't think they are going for being an all-inclusive CSS framework... I think they just wanted to provide some components that you can select from to use in your website, a la carte style.  In that respect, I'd say their components are good and nice to use in that way.  But for a thing like a blog, I needed something more.</p>

		<h5>Bootstrap</h5>

		<p>That brings me to Bootstrap.  Bootstrap really is that all-inclusive framework.  And it was love at first container for me.</p>

		<p>I like that you don't have to import every single component that you want to use like you have to do with Angular Material.  You just import it once, stick some scripts on your index html file, and go.  Bootstrap operates off classes.  If you want a container, you just add class="container" to your element.  No having to remember to import the "container" element in the app module.  Easy peasy.  Everything is nicely aligned for you, and looks good in different environments (aka, it's responsive).</p>

		<p>Another great thing about Bootstrap is all of the utilities that they add in.  You want more padding?  Add "p-2" to your element to see how it looks (p = padding, the number after is 1-5, 1 for less 5 for more).  Want to float an element?  Use the float-left class.  Uggh it is so easy to quickly tweak an element without having to actually write CSS!  CSS files get ugly and complex.  In Angular you have CSS files for each component, so they stack up and it can get confusing what is being applied where.  Writing actual CSS is good for adding global styles, like having your links be a specific color when you hover.  But for little tweaks on individual elements on a page, Bootstrap is amazing.</p>

		<p>Finally, I am a lover of good documentation.  Bootstrap delivers.  Partly because their framework makes such sense and is easy to use already, their documentation is thorough but also easy to undertand, and even, dare I say, memorize.  How hard is it to remember that p is for padding!</p>

		<p>I haven't really found anything not to love about Bootstrap.  It is great.  Thank you, Internet gods, for sending me this gift to use to structure my website.</p>

		<p>For an easy reference, here is a guide to when you might want to use Material and when to use Bootstrap on your website:</p>

		<p>Use Angular Material when:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>You are associating yourself with Google in some way (for example, a "log in with Google" screen)</li>
			<li>You want your website to look unique and interesting</li>
			<li>You already have a complete CSS framework (like Boostrap) and you're just looking to add in a few elements to make it pop</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Use Bootstrap when:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>You are developing a website...</li>
		</ul>
