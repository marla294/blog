<p>Hi there.  I'm Marla!</p>

<p>Here's my life story in one run-on sentence: Grew up in Ohio, went to University of Illinois for school, was an Electrical Engineer for a few years, a Software Quality Assurance engineer for (quite) a few more, now I'm learning Angular web development and chillaxing in Omaha, Nebraska with my 5 year old son and my (not 5 year old) husband.  If you want to know more about me, either professional or personal, you can head on over to my LinkedIn page, Github where this blog is hosted, or Twitter where I put my random thoughts.</p>

<p>About the blog - made it entirely myself.  A labor of love.  I used Angular 5.ish (upgraded from 4 to 5 in the middle of blog creation) => TypeScript => JavaScript.  The styling uses Angular Material a little bit.  This website is going to be an evolving thing, because I just enjoy tinkering with it so much, so expect to see some changes to make it better and better :)</p>
