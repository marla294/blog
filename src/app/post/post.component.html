		<p>Hi there.  I'm Marla!</p>

		<p>Here's my life story in one run-on sentence: Grew up in Ohio, went to University of Illinois for school, was an Electrical Engineer for a few years, a Software Quality Assurance engineer for (quite) a few more, now I'm learning Angular web development and chillaxing in Omaha, Nebraska with my 5 year old son and my (not 5 year old) husband.  If you want to know more about me, either professional or personal, you can head on over to my LinkedIn page, Github where this blog is hosted, or Twitter where I put my random thoughts.</p>

		<p>About the blog - made it entirely myself.  A labor of love.  I used Angular 5.ish (upgraded from 4 to 5 in the middle of blog creation) => TypeScript => JavaScript.  The styling uses Angular Material a little bit.  This website is going to be an evolving thing, because I just enjoy tinkering with it so much, so expect to see some changes to make it better and better :)</p>

		<p>First of all, since I missed Christmas and New Years with this blog... I hope anyone reading this had a great holiday season and a happy New Year!  I personally am very excited for 2018!</p>

		<p>Ironically, and eating-my-own-dogfood-ly, I am learning to be a web developer by developing this very blog you are reading... but it is getting pretty annoying having to put in test posts all the time to test out the doohickys I am making.  So I figured I would write an actual factual blog post, to fill things out a bit and to keep me away from tinkering on the blog for a second (I really need to start writing unit tests but I CAN'T. STOP. TINKERING.)</p>

		<p>As I mentioned in my "About Me" blog post, I am learning web development in Angular.  Learning it by going through the Angular docs (https://angular.io/).  Angular somewhat recently (late 2015ish) decided to switch over to using RXJS Observables for a lot of their built-in functionality (routing and http are the big ones I can think of off the cuff), and they hammer them a LOT in the docs.  Practically every cookbook has at least one Observable used in it.  Fulfilled Promises are nowhere to be found, just like in real life (sorry, professional dad-jokester here).  Observables can be a little tricky to understand, and it's kind of hard to find a good explanation about why Angular is so into them.  I'll tackle this subject and give you my take on it.</p>

		<p>The first thing to talk about is, what is this Observable thing?  Well, before RX Observables came the Observer/Subscriber design pattern, so let's describe that.  I like to think of it like a magazine.  Let's say that the Observable (also called a Subject) is Forbes magazine, and the Subscribers are people who want to get Forbes in the mail.  To get Forbes, I would have to subscribe to the magazine by sending in a subscription form, which is analogous to the "subscribe" function you'd use when working with Observables in code.  When Forbes is ready to produce a new issue, they know I want it so they will mail it to me, and the magazine will arrive at my door.  In our code example, you'd just already have the data at the same time that the Observable has it... the updated version was "delivered" to you in real time.  That's the design pattern in a nutshell.</p>

		<p>You can also think of it kind of like a "stream" of data, or like an array.  I feel these analogies are a little flawed, because you can't really get to any of the "older issues" in an Observable like you can in an array.  With an Observable, you always are holding the latest version, the "last" element in the array.  So for that reason, I don't love that analogy.  But, it is handy when looking at the operators available for use with Observables, which are very similar to functions you'd use with an array (map, anyone?).  And ReactiveX itself (see below) absolutely loves to draw pictures of Observables in the stream fashion... so I guess we might as well get used to it.</p>

		<p>I believe the "Gang of Four" (otherwise known as the "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" book) was the originator of the Observer/Subscriber design pattern (don't quote me on that).  But then a library was developed to allow people to actually create and use this pattern in many languages: ReactiveX (http://reactivex.io/).  RxJS is the javaScript version of the ReactiveX library, and is what you would use to work with Observables in Angular.</p>

		<p>So, back to the main question of this post, and the question I struggled with for a while... why use Observables?  There are a few reasons.  It streamlines code.  Rob Wormald gave a talk back when this was first rolling out in Angular (I'll link it in the References at the end) where he talks about writing code for a typeahead.  He wrote it both with and without Observables.  In the Observable-free one, he had to write a debouncing function and a few other helper functions to go along with it.  In the Observable one, they already have those operators built in, so the code was a lot shorter, cleaner, and you gotta assume that Rx knows what they're doing so it's less bug-prone than rolling your own.  On that note, the operators are another reason why Observables are cool.  There are a lot of them, and they are similar to ones you have probably already used for arrays, so it is pretty easy to get going with them.  Another major benefit is speed and efficiency.  Your subscribers don't have to go polling for updates all the time... they can just sit back, relax, have a cup of tea, and wait for their new issue of "userArray" to come to them when it is updated.</p>

	<div *ngSwitchCase="3">

		<p>If you read my last post about Observables, you'll note that this post is not about Observables like I promised.  But the idea of this post about CSS frameworks felt so good to me today and I really wanted to write it.  So, you'll just have to sit tight for that Observables post for now.</p>

		<p>I've explored 2 different CSS frameworks in the past couple months to use with the development of this website: Angular Material and Bootstrap.  I want to talk through my experience with each, and why/when you might want to use each one.</p>

		<h5>Angular Material</h5>

		<p>The first framework that I explored was Angular Material.  Angular Material is "both a UI Component framework and a reference implementation of Google's Material Design Specification" (quoth <a href="https://material.angularjs.org/1.1.3/">this page</a>).  Google Material Design is a design language... kind of a specification of how to lay things out on the web.</p>  

		<p>I thought that since I was developing in Angular, Angular Material would be a good CSS framework to compliment that.  The idea of making the web easier to use by using visual cues was appealing as well.  Ease of use and accessibility are kind of my thing.</p>

		<p>Material certainly looks cool.  Buttons have a fancy ripple effect.  When you enter text in a textbox, there's a multi-colored line that underlines it.  Their little "tags" that you can use for things like categories are fun.  Their components are really neat-looking overall.</p>

		<p>Also, it was fairly easy to install.  Since it's part of the Angular universe, and I am using Angular for my project, I could pick and choose what elements I wanted to import and bring them in on the app module, instead of having to bring in the whole thing (ala Bootstrap).</p>

		<p>But, there are some pretty hefty drawbacks to using Angular Material as your one and only CSS framework.  It's not easy to change the theming on the elements.  They make you pick a theme, and if you don't like the colors or you need more padding on something, you might need to do a ton of CSS writing to change it, or just accept that you're stuck with it.  I suppose the reason is because of all those cool effects... if you were able to easily change to some colors, those effects might break.</p>

		<p>Another drawback is that there aren't a ton of components or utilities to use.  For example, they don't have a "container" class that you could just put on a div... the closest they've got is a card element.  I don't know about you, but I didn't fancy putting my website pages onto giant cards!  I just wanted to spruce up the pages that I've got.</p>

		<p>Finally, for the above mentioned reasons, when you design stuff using Angular Material, it looks like you are associated with Google in some way.  That might legitimately be good if you have a "sign in with Google" function in your appication, or if you really are associated with Google.  But, if you're me, a Google-fangirl who is not affiliated, then it looks kinda weird.</p>

		<p>Maybe I misunderstood what Material's intended purpose is.  It does say right in their docs that they are a "component framework", not a "CSS framework".  I can see now that I don't think they are going for being an all-inclusive CSS framework... I think they just wanted to provide some components that you can select from to use in your website, a la carte style.  In that respect, I'd say their components are good and nice to use in that way.  But for a thing like the styling of a website, I needed something more.</p>

		<h5>Bootstrap</h5>

		<p>That brings me to Bootstrap.  Bootstrap really is that all-inclusive framework.  And it was love at first container for me.</p>

		<p>I like that you don't have to import every single component that you want to use like you have to do with Angular Material.  You just import it once, stick some scripts on your index html file, and go.  Bootstrap operates off classes.  If you want a container, you just add class="container" to your element.  No having to remember to import the "container" element in the app module.  Easy peasy.  Everything is nicely aligned for you, and looks good in different environments (aka, it's responsive).</p>

		<p>Another great thing about Bootstrap is all of the utilities that they add in.  You want more padding?  Add "p-2" to your element to see how it looks (p = padding, the number after is 1-5, 1 for less 5 for more).  Want to float an element?  Use the float-left class.  Uggh it is so easy to quickly tweak an element without having to actually write CSS!  CSS files get ugly and complex.  In Angular you have CSS files for each component, so they stack up and it can get confusing what is being applied where.  Writing actual CSS is good for adding global styles, like having your links be a specific color when you hover.  But for little tweaks on individual elements on a page, Bootstrap is amazing.</p>

		<p>Finally, I am a lover of good documentation.  Bootstrap delivers.  Partly because their framework makes such sense and is easy to use already, their documentation is thorough but also easy to undertand, and even, dare I say, memorize.  How hard is it to remember that p is for padding!</p>

		<h5>Summary</h5>

		<p>Overall, if you are developing a website in Angular, I would highly recommend Bootstrap over Angular Material for a CSS framework.  But if you have a specific use for Angular Material, or if you are affiliated with Google in some way, it wouldn't be too hard to add in the couple components that you need and use it in conjunction with Bootstrap.</p>

		<p>Hello!  My bad for not writing for so long.  I'm plugging away at coding.  It's hard to write blog posts about development, and takes up time that I could be spending actually making things, which is the highest priority for me.  I will write more about dev eventually... for now I wanted to take the blog in a more "traditional" direction, for a blog anyway.</p>

		<p>As you can probably tell by my one sentence About Me post, I haven't been super keen on writing about myself.  Which makes things interesting since this is a BLOG and that's kinda what seems to be expected.  I've changed a ton in the past half year.  I've changed so much that it has been hard to figure out what I really want to talk about now.  But I finally came up with an idea the other day that I love.  I want to talk about people from my past, and my present, that I deeply appreciate, and why.  Going to call it the "open letter of appreciation" series.</p>

		<p>I'm going to make up names for people that I put on here.  I just want to respect their privacy.  They'd definitely know who they are from reading these stories.</p>

		<h2>Joe, the calmest guy at Northrop Grumman</h2>

		<p>We're going to call this first guy Joe.  Joe was my coworker at Northrop Grumman, in Rolling Meadows Illinois, when I first started my career and was still doing RF engineering.  We worked together for about 2 and a half years... man I can't believe it was that long, it seems really short in retrospect.</p>

		<p>Joe is probably the calmest person I have ever met in my life.  No matter what happened, no matter if someone was freaking out or something didn't go right, Joe was just like, eh oh well, everything will probably work out.  It was flipping amazing.  NGC had a parts ordering system where, if you needed to buy a $5 pack of resistors, you had to order it on this archaic DOS look-alike system, and it would literally take a minimum of 6 months to arrive.  By the time you got them you couldn't remember why you ordered them.  I'd come over to his desk and be like WTFOMGBBQ PARTS JOE!!!!  And he would just calmly place the order for me while I finished freaking out.</p>

		<p>On top of that, Joe was extremely patient.  I'd go over to his cubicle and ask him a million questions about how things worked (he designed the stuff I was working on and was very smart) and he would sit there and answer every one of them.  I was like, 22, 23 years old and even I realized after a couple hours of questioning that, holy cow Marla this is getting ridiculous, but he was still there answering those silly questions for me!</p>

		<p>The thing that I admired the most about Joe is how he treated me, and everyone else, with respect.  No matter if you were some 22 year old newbie like me asking you questions for 2 hours straight (probably on a Monday), or if you were the head honcho, if you asked for Joe's time and attention, you got it.</p>

		<p>Something he did that makes me so happy to think about, even now, is when I quit, he threw a huge surprise "goodbye" party for me.  I had no idea about it and I went into this room and there were 30 people in there, and pizza, and they even had a slideshow about the "top 10 Marla moments!"  That was so amazing.</p>

		<p>At the time I took him for granted.  I thought every job would have a Joe in it.  I'm so appreciative that I got to work with him.  I hope things are going better than ever in his life.</p>

		<p>You may have noticed that I wrote a post last week, left it up for a day, and then "deleted" it (I say that in parenthesis because, it's never really deleted... you can go view it in the reverted changes on Github if you really want).  I wrote it, put it up, and it just didn't feel good to me.  So I took it down.  Thus is life.  Part of the post was about feeling that other people don't believe in me.  The truth is, I don't know for sure that they don't.  But, it doesn't MATTER to me anymore what they think.  That's really what I was trying to get at.  But I felt the point got obscured.  And I just really don't feel like opening that can of worms again.  I believe in myself now.  Yay.  Let's move on.</p>

		<p>Now I got a post entirely about me and how I learn.  I've been thinking about this topic a lot lately.  The way I learn is probably not so different from the way others do.  But I think over the years, because I was listening to other people's opinions on how one "should" learn things best, when I heard something different from how I do it, I labeled my way the "wrong" way and tried to do it the "right" way.  Now I see it as, there's no wrong or right way to learn things, there's just "your" way.</p>

		<p>As I mentioned in the post that was """deleted""", I've been learning how to be a software developer for the past 8 months.  I had a couple options for how to go about becoming a developer.  One was to go back to college, and the other was to go to a code bootcamp.  I have a bachelors in electrical engineering, that I obtained from a top 3 engineering school while playing golf on scholarship.  Oh and a math minor.  So yeah, after that grueling experience, more college did not sound appealing, or honestly, necessary (I'm already an engineer, yo).  I was seriously considering going to code school.  In fact I thought that was what I was doing until about a month before I started this.  But, then the idea came up that, maybe I could do this on my own... and that felt way better than any of the other options.</p>

		<p>When I was like, 11 or 12, we had a computer at home.  It eventually got moved up to my room.  I had heard about this thing called the "internet" where you could talk to people through the computer.  I heard that it worked through the phone lines.  I had a phone line in my room that wasn't hooked up to anything.  So... I recall spending a day tinkering and trying everything I could to get that computer somehow hooked up to the internet.  I found a rubber hose, and jerry-rigged something to go from the phone line to the computer.  There was a settings application on my computer that said something about internet on it and I tried typing all kinds of stuff to try to connect.  Unfortunately, after 3 or so hours of tinkering, nothing worked and I gave up.</p>

		<p>That's how I roll when it comes to learning or, anything really.  I throw out the instruction manual, and just try crap until something works.  In school and in college, I noted that classes themselves really didn't help me learn that much.  I went to them, because I always worried if I didn't go I would miss something.  But the real thing that helped me learn was trying to do the math or engineering problem myself, looking at the answer in the back of the book, and if I didn't get it right, trying things until I did.  That was really the only thing that worked for me.</p>

		<p>I've heard a lot that other people swear by working with other people, or working in groups.  I'd study in the library in college and there would be tables of 20 people working together.  That's great for you, other people.  I wish so hard that I could do that.  But other people and their weird thoughts about how to solve the problem at hand distract me.  I'd rather struggle through it on my own.</p>

		<p>Another "weird" thing about me and how I learn and just, do... things... in the world?, is that I like to just visualize the outcome and then when I'm ready, take steps toward it.</p>

		<p>When I was in college, I played on the women's golf team.  There was a assistant coach on our team who was really into studying the course, and writing down every little detail in her yardage book, during the practice round before the tournament.  She said she would hit a ball to each side of the fairway on her drive, then hit 2-3 balls toward the green, study how the green sloped, study how the wind was blowing... basically study every dang thing on every hole of the course and write it in that book.  Probably no surprise this coach is now a lawyer.</p>

		<p>Anyway, this approach sounded very appealing to me.  There was a kind of "it's all planned out for me" orderly feeling to it.  So, there was a tournament where we had to play 36 holes in a day, and I decided to try her approach out.  The first 18 holes, I used that yardage book, I studied and analyzed every shot, and I used the club the yardage book and my brain said to use.  Shot a 78, which is not bad.  But following that yardage book was pretty tiring.  I decided to go back to my old way of doing it for the second round.  My "old way" consisted of, looking at the fairway, visualizing where I wanted my shot to go, and then hitting it that way.  Then when I would walk up to the next shot, I'd be thinking about how I wanted that shot to go... and so on.  On the second round, I shot a 75.  From that day forward, I ditched the "yardage book" idea and just kept on working the same way that had worked for me all those years before.</p>

		<p>I still get caught up trying to over-analyze my way through things.  It seems like fun.  And it obviously works for some times of people - see example high-powered lawyer/former assistant coach above.  Those types of people seem like they've got it together.  But... I'm just not like that.  Planning, for me, obscures the real work of just, doing the thing.</p>

		<p>It gets weird when it comes to learning to code.  You gotta learn the language, obviously, and that involves going through tutorials and "analyzing," which to me feels like the golf coach writing things down in her book, but it's necessary.  But then, after a while, I needed to just put the Angular Docs webpage down, and just code something.  It's a fine line between analyzing and doing.</p>

		<p>Well, that's all I've got for today.  Later!</p>
